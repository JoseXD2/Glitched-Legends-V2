v1:how much
v2:how much if you want a randomizer

ok the difference between v1 and v2 that if you put only
v1 the image will popup with the amount of numbers that you put with v1

example (v1 = 5)
that means they're will be 5 popups

but if you put v2 and v1 the amount will randomize
example (v1 = 1, v2 = 5)
that means ether 1 to 5 popups maybe only 1popup or 3popups or full5 popups
the limit of popups are 100
sorry if this is confusing lol
